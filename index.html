          <p>Hi! I'm 19 and from Delhi.</p>
          <p>I enjoy designing and coding stuff, reading and writing stories and poems,
            learning new languages and listening to music and do photography.</p>
          <p>My goal of this year is to finish 10 webdev projects and learn 500 kanji.</p>
          <p>Hm... Nishit sounds nice I guess? It means "SHarp and Intelligent",
            which sounds really awesome.</p>
        </div>
